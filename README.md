# 🧾 Chess Scoresheet Generator

A practical Python tool for generating multi-page DIN A5 chess scoresheets from PGN files — perfect for tournaments, clubs, or personal archives.

## 🔧 Features

- Processes PGN files with one or multiple games
- Creates a clean, multi-column PDF scoresheet for each game
- Optional JPG export for each page
- ZIP export of all PDFs/JPGs
- Supports very long Games (unlimited move numbers)
- Displays player names, date, event, and Elo ratings (if available)
- Includes a progress bar using `tqdm` for smooth CLI feedback
- DIN A5 layout (148 × 210 mm) for compact printing
- Optional logo in the top-right corner (e.g. club logo)
- Graceful fallback for missing PGN tags or logo
- Logo top left corner (Optional)
- Simple GUI

For logo place a file named logo.png in the same directory.Recommended: square, transparent PNG, approx. 100×100 px.


## 📦 Installation
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. (Windows only) Install Poppler:
   - Download from [Poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases)
   - Extract and note the path to the `poppler/bin` folder
3. Install dependencies:
   bash pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## 📁 Output
For each game in the PGN file, the tool generates:
•	White_vs_Black_GameX.pdf
•	White_vs_Black_GameX_page_1.jpg, page_2.jpg, …


## 💻Examples how to use
	python scoresheet -h for help
	python scoresheet_generator.py game1.pgn game2.pgn 
	python scoresheet_generator.py *.pgn
	pyton scoresheet_generator.py  games.pgn --jpg Enable JPG export (disabled by default)
	python scoresheet_generator.py games.pgn --outdir scoresheets

	Included are two simple example.pgn files to test with single and multiple games within the pgn files. The program also works fast processing pgn files containing hundreds of chess games. 
	Jpg conversion takes some time, it must be enabled with the --jpg flag.

	
## 🧠 Notes
•	Elo ratings are shown only if present in the PGN headers (WhiteElo, BlackElo)
•	Layout is optimized for DIN A5 — ideal for printing or digital archiving
•	JPG export uses pdf2image and requires Poppler
